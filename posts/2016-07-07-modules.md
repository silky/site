title: Embedding ML Modules in Haskell
---

ML-style modules precisely capture the notion of modularity; implementations are first-class objects of their own, and one can talk about signatures, i.e. APIs *modulo implementation*.


Modules are tools for abstraction, i.e. they separate implementation and signature in a way that one can build signatures. In ML terms, this is `structure` and `signature`.



We create singleton types that serve as witnesses that our type implements a module signature.



Choosing alternative implementations requires one to create not only different types, but also a whole corpus of conversion functions.

A prime example is how `Int` is not a monoid, because we can't choose whether we mean the additive monoid or the multiplicative monoid.
