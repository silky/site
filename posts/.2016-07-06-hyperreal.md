> "The map is not the territory"

Let `F` be an endofunctor that takes territories to their maps, i.e. things to their abstractions, i.e. signified to their signs.

```haskell
mapₓ = F(x)
```

When is the map the territory?

```haskell
mapₓ = x = F(x)
```

When the map is the solution to the equation `x = F(x)`, ie. the map is a fixed point of our (initial algebra???????)


<sub>Notice `x = F(x)` holds true for all x when F is the identity functor.</sub>

At a fixed point, `F(x)` is isomorphic to `X`

Hyperreality is a fixed point of semiosis; when the signs becomes indistinguishable from the signified.





The map is the territory.
